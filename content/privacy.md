I do not collect personal information when you visit my site. However, to measure visitor traffic, Google Analytics collects some information, including browser type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while browsing the site, page access times, and referring website address. This information is presented to me in aggregated reports, and is only used to track visitor traffic and trends. 

Here is [the Google Analytics privacy page](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) that explains more about what data is collected, and how it is used. 

You can easily reduce the level of tracking by adjusting some of your browser setting. Learn more at [All About Do Not Track](https://allaboutdnt.com/).
