 abstract = {Conclusion. FH children display higher PBMC expression of immune-related genes mapped to several pathways, including T and B cells, and TNFSF than healthy children. Our results suggest that LDL-C plays an important role in modulating expression of different immune-related genes, and novel data on the involvement of these pathways in the early atherosclerosis may represent future therapeutic targets for prevention of atherosclerotic progression.},
