 abstract = {SCOPE: Some studies suggest that a high dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids is pro-inflammatory. However, whether omega-6 fatty acids actually cause pathogenic inflammation in humans is debated. Therefore, the associations between expression of immunology-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum total omega-6 PUFA status are investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Serum fatty acid profile and expression of 460 immunology-related genes in PBMCs from 58 healthy children (6-13 years) is measured, and examined the expression differences between children with high or low total omega-6 PUFA status (upper vs lower tertile). Taken together, both univariate analyses and integrated omics analyses support that while high omega-6 PUFA level associated with higher expressing of genes related to innate immune responses, it also associated with lower expression of several genes related to adaptive immune responses. CONCLUSION: Omega-6 PUFA status associated both positively and negatively with expression of specific immunology-related genes in PBMCs in healthy children. The results may suggest a nuanced role for omega-6 fatty acids in the interphase of lipids and inflammation, and warrants further examination in gene-environment studies and randomized controlled trials.},
