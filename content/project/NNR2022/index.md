The Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) constitutes the scientific basis for national nutrient recommendations and food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The international collaboration between the five Nordic countries has resulted in the previous five editions of the NNR.

The most recent edition of the NNR (NNR2012) was launched in 2012/13 and published in 2014. Since then, a large number of scientific studies have emerged, underscoring the need for updating the NNR.

The new edition (NNR2022) will be published in 2022. In addition to include an update on NNR for energy, macro- and micronutrients, NNR2022 will develop evidence-based platforms for the national FBDG as well as the integration of overweight and obesity, and sustainability and environmental issues into FBDG.
